<p>In my free time I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, and being outdoors.  Growing up I played soccer, baseball, and basketball.  I love spending time with my family and friends when I can.  In the future I plan to pursue a degree in business.  I would like to go to college somewhere in California, more than likely southern California.  I enjoy traveling with my family and friends in the summer.  I have been to various countries in South America, Europe, Asia, and North America.  Out of all the places that I've traveled to I enjoyed Iceland the most. I love going to the beach, the mountains, the desert, and more.  I have one younger sister and a younger half brother.</p>
